# Lab Scenario Preview - 08 - Create a multi-tier solution by using Azure services

## Lab Scenario
In this proof of concept, you will create a containerized application to host a web app on Azure, as the source of information for the API. You will then build an API proxy using the Azure API Management capabilities to expose and test your APIs. Developers can query the APIs to test the service and validate its applicability.

## Objective
+ Exercise 1: Create an Azure App Service resource by using a Docker container image
    + Task 1: Open the Azure portal
    + Task 2: Create a web app by using Azure App Service resource by using an httpbin container image
    + Task 3: Test the httpbin web application
+ Exercise 2: Build an API proxy tier by using Azure API Management
    + Task 1: Create an API Management resource
    + Task 2: Define a new API
    + Task 3: Manipulate an API response
    + Task 4: Manipulate an API request
