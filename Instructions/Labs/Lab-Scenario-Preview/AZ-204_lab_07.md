# Lab Scenario Preview - 07 - Access resource secrets more securely across services

## Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will create a storage account and an Azure Function app that will access the storage account. To demonstrate the secure storage of connection string information, you will provision a Key Vault resource and manage the appropriate secrets to store the connection string information. You will also manage the service identity to gain secure access to the connection string information for the storage account.

## Objective
+ Exercise 1: Create Azure resources
    + Task 1: Open the Azure portal
    + Task 2: Create a Storage account
    + Task 3: Create an Azure Key Vault
    + Task 4: Create a Function app
+ Exercise 2: Configure secrets and identities
    + Task 1: Configure a system-assigned managed service identity
    + Task 2: Create a Key Vault secret
    + Task 3: Configure a Key Vault access policy
   + Task 4: Create a Key Vault-derived application setting
+ Exercise 3: Build an Azure Functions app
    + Task 1: Initialize a function project
    + Task 2: Create an HTTP-triggered function
    + Task 3: Configure and read an application setting
    + Task 4: Validate the local function
    + Task 5: Deploy the function using the Azure Functions Core Tools
    + Task 6: Test the Key Vault-derived application setting
+ Exercise 4: Access Azure Blob Storage data
    + Task 1: Upload a sample storage blob
    + Task 2: Pull and configure the Azure SDK for .NET
    + Task 3: Write Azure Blob Storage code using the Azure SDK for .NET
    + Task 4: Deploy and validate the Azure Functions app
