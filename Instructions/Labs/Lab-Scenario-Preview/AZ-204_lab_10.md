# Lab Scenario Preview - 10 - Asynchronously process messages by using Azure Service Bus Queues

# Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will create a proof of concept for this scenario by employing an Azure Service Bus Queue. To demonstrate how the system could function, you will create a .NET Core project that will publish messages to the system, and a second .NET Core application that will read messages from the queue. The first app will simulate data coming from a sensor, while the second app will simulate the system that will read the messages from the queue for processing.

## Objective
+ Exercise 1: Create Azure resources
    + Task 1: Open the Azure portal
    + Task 2: Create an Azure Service Bus queue
+ Exercise 2: Create a .NET Core project to publish messages to a Service Bus queue
    + Task 1: Create a .NET Core project
    + Task 2: Publish messages to an Azure Service Bus queue
+ Exercise 3: Create a .NET Core project to read messages from a Service Bus queue
    + Task 1: Create a .NET project
    + Task 2: Read messages from an Azure Service Bus queue
